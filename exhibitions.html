                        Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night 
                        sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations 
                        and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.

                        For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do 
                        we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a 
                        framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.

                        From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique 
                        insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.

                        For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved,
                         thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history
                          of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the 
                          first heart transplant.

                        Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing 
                        animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                        As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it
                         becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for
                          the whole planet.

                         warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
                          contribute to a brighter future.
